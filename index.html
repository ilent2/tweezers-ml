This website presents three simulations demonstrating how
machine learning enables fast optical tweezers simulations that
can be run in most web browsers and on most smart phones.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
These simulations shows the optical forces acting on spherical
particles in tightly focussed laser beams.  The forces are calculated
using a pre-trained artificial neural networks, allowing for fast and
accurate execution in-browser (on your phone or personal computer).
The simulation using a finite difference method to simulate particle
dynamics, accuracy of this method depends on simulation parameters,
not all simulation parameters will produce physically accurate results.
Training data was generated using the
<a href="https://github.com/ilent2/ott">optical tweezers toolbox</a>.
We used <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> to train the neural
network and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a>
to evaluate the neural network in browser.
